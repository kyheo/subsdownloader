SubsDownloader
==============
Automatically download subtitles for a list of files in an incoming queue
directory, and store both (video and subtitle) in an outgoing one.

This first version will use "opensubtitles.org":http://opensubtitles.org API.
To get the best subtitle match, this first version will need the video file just
to get a hash from it, later version will work with name lists.
